## Important Instructions

### How to run the model

- The attributes filled by the user from the webpage form should be stored in ```prediction/value_to_predict.csv```.
- Run ```python modelLoader.py``` in the root directory. The model will run with the ```prediction/value_to_predict.csv``` values.
- The Predicted Label will be stored in txt format at ```prediction/predicted_label.txt```. This Predicted Label(0 or 1) will be displayed to the user.

##### ```modelLoader.py```, ```prediction/value_to_predict.csv```, ```prediction/predicted_label.txt``` are the files that are for you to look at.

Note: 
- Install sklearn.
- git pull if I try to change the accuracy coz model file will change.
